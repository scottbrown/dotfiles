dotfiles
========

A set of dotfiles for use on any machine, development or production.

## Installation

The first thing to notice is that none of the file contain a period (.) prefixed to their name.  This is done so that the files show up easily in your directory.

To install the files, simply copy them to your home directory and prefix a period (.) to their names.  For instance, when installing the vimrc file:

```
$ cp vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
