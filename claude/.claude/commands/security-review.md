Analyze the codebase and think very hard.  Perform a security review of the codebase and find any vulnerabilities.  For each vulnerability found, determine the type of vulnerability, its severity (based on how the code paths work), and how to fix the vulnerability.

The output is a detailed report with a summary at the end.  Ask the user if they want to save the report in a file named `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`.
