Analyze the codebase and think hard so that you understand how the codebase works.  Create a presentation in Marp-flavoured markdown and save it into a file named `PRESENTATION.md`.  Ensure that the target audience for this presentation are newcomers to the codebase. These newcomers have software development skills, but otherwise have not seen the codebase or how to build it.  The purpose of this presentation is to reduce the learning curve and increase the time to productive value for these software developers.
